# ConnMatTools - Tools for working with connectivity matrices

## Description

Collects several different methods for analyzing and
working with connectivity matrices in R.  Though primarily oriented
towards marine larval dispersal, many of the methods are general and
useful for terrestrial systems as well.

## Installation of latest version via github

The latest development version of the package can be installed directly from
[github](https://github.com/) using the
[devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools)
R package. First that package needs to be installed:

     install.packages("devtools")

Once this is done, one can install the development version with:

     require("devtools")
     install_github("ConnMatTools","dmkaplan2000","master")

Replace "master" with another branch, tag or commit to obtain a
different version of the package.
