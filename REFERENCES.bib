	abstract = {Marine reserves are an increasingly important tool for the management of marine ecosystems around the world. However, the effects of proposed marine reserve configurations on sustainability and yield of populations are typically not estimated because of the computational intensity of direct simulation and uncertainty in larval dispersal and density-dependent recruitment. Here we develop a method for efficiently assessing a marine reserve configuration for persistence and yield of a population with sedentary adults and dispersing larvae. The method extends the familiar sustainability criteria of individual replacement for single populations based on eggs-per-recruit ({EPR)} to spatially distributed populations with sedentary adults, a dispersing larval phase, and limited carrying capacity in the settlement-recruit relationship. We refer to this approach as dispersal-per-recruit ({DPR).} In some cases, a single {DPR} calculation, based on the assumption that post-settlement habitat is saturated (i.e., at maximum recruitment), is sufficient to determine population persistence, while in other cases further iterative calculations are required. These additional calculations reach an equilibrium more rapidly than a full simulation of age- or size-structured populations. From the {DPR} result, fishery yield can be computed from yield-per-recruit ({YPR)} at each point. We assess the utility of {DPR} calculations by applying them to single reserves, uniformly distributed systems of reserves, and randomly sized and spaced systems of reserves on a linear coast line. We find that for low levels of {EPR} in fished areas (e.g., 10\% or less of the natural, unfished {EPR} when post-settlement habitats are saturated by 35\% of natural settlement), a single {DPR} calculation is sufficient to determine persistence of the population. We also show that, in uniform systems of reserves with finite reserve size, maximal fisheries yield occurs when the density of reserves is such that all post-settlement habitat is nearly saturated with settlers. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this approach to a realistic proposed marine reserve configuration.},

	abstract = {Conservation and management of natural resources and biodiversity need improved criteria to select functional networks of protected areas. The connectivity within networks due to dispersal is rarely considered, partly because it is unclear how connectivity information can be included in the selection of protected areas. We present a novel and general method that applies eigenvalue perturbation theory ({EPT)} to select optimum networks of protected areas based on connectivity. At low population densities, characteristic of threatened populations, this procedure selects networks that maximize the growth rate of the overall network. This method offers an improved link between connectivity and metapopulation dynamics. Our framework is applied to connectivities estimated for marine larvae and demonstrates that, for open populations, the best strategy is to protect areas acting as both strong donors and recipients of recruits. It should be possible to implement an {EPT} framework for connectivity analysis into existing holistic tools for design of protected areas.},

	abstract = {Spatially explicit models are needed to thoroughly evaluate the potential effectiveness of marine protected areas in particular locations. These models have traditionally parameterized a spatially non-varying settler–recruit relationship ({SRR)}, which is often the large-scale, non-spatial stock–recruitment or egg–recruit relationship used for stock assessments. A recent study demonstrated that the initial slope of local {SRRs} should be adjusted so as to correctly estimate population persistence, and proposed an analytical methodology to carry out the adjustment. This methodology cannot be used to evaluate small-scale {SRRs} for more complex spatially explicit models, in particular when adults of the study population are mobile beyond simple home range movements. Here we propose a numerical methodology for estimating the parameters of local {SRRs} for complex spatially and seasonally explicit population models, from parameters of a large-scale, non-spatial {SRR.} The consideration of spatial and seasonal patterns of fishing mortality rates, reproduction and larval dispersal results in discrepancies between spatial monthly models and equivalent non-spatial annual models in terms of global spawning stock biomass. The adjustment of the initial slope of small-scale {SRRs} is necessary so as not to underestimate population persistence, and also reduces discrepancies between spatially and seasonally explicit models and their non-spatial annual counterparts.},

	abstract = {Dispersal on the landscape/seascape scale may lead to complex spatial population structure with non-synchronous demography and genetic divergence. In this study we present a novel approach to identify subpopulations and dispersal barriers based on estimates of dispersal probabilities on the landscape scale. A theoretical framework is presented where the landscape connectivity matrix is analyzed for clusters as a signature of partially isolated subpopulations. Identification of subpopulations is formulated as a minimization problem with a tuneable penalty term that makes it possible to generate population subdivisions with varying degree of dispersal restrictions. We show that this approach produces superior results compared to alternative standard methods. We apply this theory to a dataset of modeled dispersal probabilities for a sessile marine invertebrate with free-swimming larvae in the Baltic Sea. For a range of critical connectivities we produce a hierarchical partitioning into subpopulations spanning dispersal probabilities that are typical for both genetic divergence and demographic independence. The mapping of subpopulations suggests that the Baltic Sea includes a fine-scale (100–600 km) mosaic of invisible dispersal barriers. An analysis of the present network of marine protected areas reveal that protection is very unevenly distributed among the suggested subpopulations. Our approach can be used to assess the location and strength of dispersal barriers in the landscape, and identify conservation units when extensive genotyping is prohibitively costly to cover necessary spatial and temporal scales, e.g. in spatial management of marine populations.},
