ConnMatTools 0.3.0
------------------

* Finished initial release of package including code for Bayesian-based estimation of 
  relative connectivity.
  
* Also include somes fixes to DPRHomeRange function and a number of minor changes to meet
  new CRAN standards.

ConnMatTools 0.2.1
------------------

* Alpha release of package including Bayesian-based code for estimating relative connectivity.  
  Most of the central functions are available, plus some tests, but a few more pieces 
  need to be added.

ConnMatTools 0.2.0
------------------

* Alpha release of package including initial code for relative connecitvity estimation 
  from field observations

ConnMatTools 0.1.5
------------------

* Small fixes to avoid errors in test script for optimal splitting of connectivity
  matrices.

ConnMatTools 0.1.4
------------------

* Updating version to prepare for submission to CRAN and transfer to github.

ConnMatTools 0.1.2
------------------

* Added function written by Marco Andrello for applying eigenvalue perturbation 
  method in Jacobi & Jonsson (2011) to reserve selection based on connectivity.

ConnMatTools 0.1.1
------------------

* Added several tests, a test dataset and functions for calculating basic statistics 
  on connectivity matrices.

ConnMatTools 0.1
----------------

* Initial release containing code for breaking connectivity matrices into 
  subpopulations and running basic spatial population dynamics models.
* Needs a lot more debugging and test codes.
