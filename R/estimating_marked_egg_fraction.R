#' Fraction of eggs marked for male and female mark transmission
#' 
#' Estimates the fraction of eggs produced at the source site that are the 
#' result of crossing parents, one or both of which have been genotyped. Based 
#' on the assumption that probability of breeding between pairs of individuals 
#' is completely independent of whether or not one or more of those individuals 
#' was genotyped.

#' Estimates of fraction of eggs marked accounting for variability in 
#' reproductive output
#' 
#' This function estimates the fraction of eggs "marked" at a site (where the 
#' "mark" could be micro-chemical or genetic) taking into account uncertainty in
#' female (and potentially male in the case of dual genetic mark transmission) 
#' reproductive output. It generates a set of potential values for the fraction 
#' of eggs marked assuming that reproductive output of each marked or unmarked 
#' mature individual is given by a random variable drawn from a single 
#' probability distribution with known mean and standard deviation (or 
#' equivalently coefficient of variation) \strong{and} that the numbers 
#' of marked and unmarked individuals are large enough that the central limit 
#' theorem applies and, therefore, their collective reproductive outputs are 
#' reasonably well described by a gamma distribution whose mean and standard 
#' deviation are appropriately scaled based on the number of individual 
#' reproducers.  The function also returns the total egg production 
#' corresponding to each fraction of marked eggs, needed for estimating absolute
#' connectivity values (i.e., elements of the connectivity matrix needed for 
#' assessing population persistence).
#' 
#' @param n Number of random values to estimates
#' @param n.females Total number of mature females in the population
#' @param n.marked.females Number of marked females in population
#' @param mean.female Mean egg production of each mature female. Defaults to 1.
#' @param cv.female Coefficient of variation of reproductive output of an 
#'   individual mature female
#' @param dual Logical variable. If \code{TRUE}, then the fraction of marked 
#'   eggs is calculated assuming dual (male and female) mark transmission. 
#'   Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param male.uncert Logical variable. If \code{TRUE}, then variability in male
#'   sperm output is also taken into account when estimating the number of 
#'   marked eggs. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param n.males Total number of mature males in the population. Only used if 
#'   \code{dual=TRUE}. Defaults to being equal to \code{n.females}.
#' @param n.marked.males Number of marked males in population. Only used if 
#'   \code{dual=TRUE}. Defaults to being equal to \code{n.marked.females}.
#' @param mean.male Mean sperm production of each mature male. Only used if 
#'   \code{dual=TRUE} and \code{male.uncert=TRUE}. Defaults to being equal to 
#'   \code{mean.female}.
#' @param cv.male Coefficient of variation of reproductive output of an 
#'   individual mature male. Only used if \code{dual=TRUE} and 
#'   \code{male.uncert=TRUE}. Defaults to being equal to \code{cv.female}.
#' @param p.marked.females Fraction of marked females in population. Can be 
#'   supplied instead of \code{n.marked.females}. Ignored if 
#'   \code{n.marked.females} is given.
#' @param p.marked.males Fraction of marked males in population. Can be supplied
#'   instead of \code{n.marked.males}. Only used if \code{dual=TRUE}. Ignored if
